	<p>Throughout history there has been an increasing phenomena of police involved fatal force. Unfortunately, many of these cases go unnoticed and much of the data is not being collected nor updated. With a purpose similar to our client, the UW Fatal Force Research Group, we want to bring awareness to the public regarding police involved fatal force. With our research project, and perhaps future research based upon recommendations for further analysis, we want to drive public discussion to address these issues. This website will serve as the host for such.</p>

	<p>Our stakeholders include the general public, public agencies, and other key research priorities. With a collective motivation, we want to determine if there are any unusual patterns and change points in the locations and numbers of people killed by police, mainly from 2013 to 2016, and in regards to the policies that were passed within those years. This includes fatality trends at the regional, state, county and national levels. Once we have a focus on our scale, we will begin to further our analysis based off trends and change points found.</p>

	<p>With the many reasons present as to why police involved fatal force is such a big issue, we intend to identify the patterns in fatalities across time and space. Especially now more than ever, with the constant headlines made across all the social media platforms of police brutality, our group is extremely interested in social justices regarding these events. Unfortunately, currently there is a gap in knowledge when it comes to archiving information on cases of fatal force in the US. In addition, many police departments do not publically offer this information. To fill in the gaps of knowledge, questions were created to answer issues related to variables such as time, space, age, gender, and race.</p>

	<p>This is the website addition to the final report for GEOG469: GIS Workshop taught by Professor Timothy Nyerges of the Geography Department at the University of Washington, Spring Quarter of 2018.</p>
