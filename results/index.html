title: US Distribution of Police Involved Fatalities
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Discussion of Results</h1>
	<p>For our project, we had five main need to know questions: “What are the demographics of the victims?”, “When did these cases happen?”, “Where are the cases of fatal force happening?”, “What are the methods of force between male, female, and transgender used in the events that resulted in fatality?”, and “Which states do we see a decrease in declining fatality?”. Dynamic and static maps were produced to answer these questions, generated by both the UW Fatal Force Research Group and some by our team.</p>

	<h2>What are the demographics of the victims?</h2>
	<p>The graph for this need to know question, generated by the UW FFRG, was split into the demographics of race, age, and gender. While doing a comparison across time, a comparison is first done through the subjects’ race and age. The race shown is split into blacks, latinos, and whites. From the visualization, we can see that whites, compared to latinos and blacks, has fatalities more evenly spread across age, and the distribution increases with time. Blacks and latinos on the other hand, has the most fatalities during the ages of 20-30, peaking at the mid-20’s. Further analysis has to be done at a per fatality level in order to accurately determine the reason why, but the general can infer that there must be some biases involved as the distribution of white victims increasingly spreads out by age, yet blacks and latinos, people of color, seems to keep peaking at the fatal ages of their 20’s.</p>
	<p>The second graph generated by the UW FFRG is a comparison across time, split between subjects’ gender and age. Through the graph, a difference in distribution can be seen between the years of 2013 compared to 2014-2015 and 2016-2017. In recent years, the correlation between female and males seems to be catching up to each other as the blue and pink colors more closely overlap each other. In comparison, the years 2014 and 2015 has more distribution between females across time compared to their counterparts. Fatality for females had a drastic decrease in distribution from 2014 to 2017. In 2014, female fatality developed a peak into their 50’s, but that peak is barely visible in 2017. Deeper analysis should be done to more accurately determine the reason for this shift in distribution. Overall, the peak age of fatality for males seems to be increasing, from mid-20’s in 2013 to late-20’s in 2017.</p>

	<h2>When did these cases happen?</h2>
	<p>From the ShinyApp created by the UW FFRG, we can use the interactive choropleth map to answer our question of when. The choropleth depicts the fatal encounters by state at a level of civilian deaths by police per million capita across time. Using this map, a selection of year can be done to show the density of fatalities for the US. Using this, for the year 2016, we can see that there is high intensity for the states of New Mexico and Alaska. With this knowledge, a deeper analysis can be done to determine current events for those states in 2016 and tying them into policies passed or not passed that resulted in the concentration of fatalities.</p>

	<h2>Where are the cases of fatal force happening?</h2>
	<p>Using ArcMap and Leaflet, our group used the Getis-Ord Gi*, a mapping cluster analysis tool also known as hot spot analysis, to determine the highest values of cases per capita and lowest values of cases per capita. At first glance, much of the northeast counties of Washington state show some high values and the southeast counties show some low values. After running the hot spot analysis, Stevens County showed a 99% confidence for highest values of cases per capita. Although Stevens county has a smaller amount of fatal force cases, the county also has a small population creating a high per capita value. This analysis was only done for the state of Washington and at county level.</p>

	<h2>What are the methods of force between male, female, and transgender used in the events that resulted in fatality?</h2>
	<p>The bar graphs for this need to know question, generated by the UW FFRG, was split into the variables of male, female and transgender in addition to the type of force used. The types of force are split into the categories of chemical, gun, restraint, taser, vehicle, and other. Although the data for the transgender variable was not apparent until 2015, we can see an apparent increase from the years of 2015 to 2017. At first glance, the most common method of force resulting in fatality is gun, even when it comes to transgender. As such, we can conclude that vast changes in policies needs to be done for gun reforms, especially when it comes to police brutality. A discussion can be opened in regards to police usage of guns when it comes to dealing with victims. This includes opening past cases and asking questions such as “Was the gun used only in dire and extreme circumstances?” or “Were guns used as a police routine, regardless of circumstances?”. Using the bar graphs, an inference can also be made when comparing females to males. Such as that females are more likely to be killed with a vehicle compared to their male counterparts - with the percentages increasing across time.</p>

	<h2>Which states do we see a decrease in fatality?</h2>
	<p>Professor Marwick introduced the method of change point analysis to determine the years in which significant changes are seen for each state to answer this question. We approached this question by first determining which states had a general decrease in police involved fatalities by applying a simple negative slope formula for each state. We concluded with the states of Hawaii, Illinois, California, Missouri and Nebraska to have a decline in police involved fatality. Using the resulting states, we picked large populated cities of each state to do research on the policies that were enacted in regards to police force with guns. For the cities of Anchorage, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, Lincoln, and St. Louis, we found three policies that each city had in common. 5 out of the 6 cities require de-escalation before use of fatal force. 3 out of the 6 requires warning before shooting. And 3 out of the 6 requires police to exhaust all other means before shooting. With the change point analysis and decrease in fatality evidence, these policies can be used as evidence for other states to enact for their cities.</p>
