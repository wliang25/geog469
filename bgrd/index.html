	<h1>Background and Problem Statement</h1>

	<p><b>Background: </b>Our research project group consists of three undergraduate Geography students at the University of Washington: Dan Castro, John Crinkey, and Wendy Liang. With information from UW FFRG, an in-depth analysis and further aggregation of publically sourced datasets were done to motivate discussion on the social justices that revolve around police involved fatalities. UW Fatal Force Research Group (FFRG) started at the University of Washington by Professor Martina Morris. Morris’ background in sociology and statistics led her to creating this research group to fight injustice in police using fatal force. FFRG’s mission is to bring justice and peace to communities most impacted by police fatal force.</p>

	<p>This research group started at the beginning of 2017 with two students of Martina Morris. Jainul Vaghasia scraped, cleaned, and merged the two datasets called killedbypolice and US Police Shootings Database to form the dataset Fatal Encounters. Madeline Cummins is the undergraduate who created the ShinyApp to demonstrate visualizations of the data. Ben Marwick, one of the professors, studies Archeology but also has a background in statistics and social science. Because of Marwick’s background he was approached by Morris to join the team.</p>

	<p><b>Problem Statement: </b>With the dataset provided by Jainul Vaghasia, we looked at some important locational questions to help us conclude our hypothesis around de-escalation policies and a correlation to declining per capita values. We analyzed different variables that included age, race, gender, and method of force. With a combination of our findings we related it back to the state of Washington to give some credibility to Washington’s Initiative 940. I-940 was introduced to provide training on violence de-escalation.</p>

	<p>With the product of this website, in addition to the <a href="https://ben-marwick.shinyapps.io/FFSG-ShinyApp/">ShinyApp</a> created by the UW Fatal Force Research Group, we hope that we can submit it to WA state legislative committees with empirically-grounded recommendations on how to reduce the number of people killed by police in Washington state. This website, similar to the ShinyApp will include tables from the fatalencounter dataset gathered by the UW FFRG, graphs that depict the dataset, digital interactive maps of different locations and scales of analysis with the data and change point analytics made. In addition, we hope to provide written interpretations and discussions of results alongside each visualization to accurately drive our purpose and objectives for the research project across to our audience.</p>
